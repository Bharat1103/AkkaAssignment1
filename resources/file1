Akka Assignment 1

Messages and immutability

IMPORTANT: Messages can be any kind of object but have to be immutable.
Scala can’t enforce immutability (yet) so this has to be by convention.
Primitives like String, Int, Boolean are always immutable. Apart from 
these the recommended approach is to use Scala case classes which are
immutable (if you don’t explicitly expose the state) and works great 
with pattern matching at the receiver side.
